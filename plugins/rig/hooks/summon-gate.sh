Blocked by rig/guard/summon-gate: the hourly CodeRabbit routine summons reviews, not sessions (Sumit1993/rig#150).
CodeRabbit allows one review per developer per hour across every repo, so a hand summon takes the routine's slot.
Instead: fix, push once, reply in every thread with cr-reply.sh, then re-read isResolved a few minutes later:
CodeRabbit resolves a fixed thread from the reply itself, with no re-review (prismalens PR #160). Never use \`full review\` as a retry: the "does not re-review already reviewed
commits" line is a footer on every reply. If the operator asks for a summon on this PR, record it on the same
command: CR_SUMMON_OK=${pr:-<pr>} gh pr comment ${pr:-<pr>} --body \$'@coderabbitai review\n\n<!-- summoned-by: session -->'${token:+ (the token names $token)}
