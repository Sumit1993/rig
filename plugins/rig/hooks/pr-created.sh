# PostToolUse(Bash) hook: the first time a PR URL shows up in any Bash output,
# inject a reminder to pick a watcher: /autofix-pr by default, the pr-babysit Monitor for a
# held round. Deduped per PR, so each one
# prompts once and never again.
# Silent (exit 0, no output) for every other Bash call.
# Rung: hook. Skipped: impossible (no harness feature auto-attaches watchers), check (the PR URL appears only in tool output).
#
# Matching the URL rather than the `gh pr create` command is deliberate. A PR
# raised inside a delegated lane never puts that string in the session's own
# command, so the old text match saw nothing and no watcher was ever armed.
# Any path that surfaces a PR is a path that needs a watcher. Story: prismalens#495.
#
# Registered on Bash AND Agent. An agy lane redirects its output to a file, so the URL
# never reaches a Bash tool_response and this hook cannot see it; it arrives later in the
# handler subagent's report, which is an Agent tool_response. That firing point also
# matters: a subagent cannot hold a Monitor (it dies with its turn), so the nudge has to
# land in the main session. Story: gh-workflows#69, reviewed and unwatched.
#
# Reviews are advisory and posted by CI; no required check waits on one, and
# nothing local has to run for a required check to go green. So this hook seeds the
# watcher's seen-state (mechanical, and the step most often skipped) and reminds the
# session to arm the Monitor, which only the model can do.
