# Escape: name agy anywhere in the prompt or description. Considering it is the rule;

# Rung: hook. Skipped: impossible (no deny rule distinguishes delegable intent), check (prompts exist only at spawn time).

Blocked by the delegation rule (AGENTS.md §Delegation): this reads as bounded, mechanical
work, which belongs on agy (separate abundant quota), not a Claude subagent (scarce pool).

Load the `farm-out` skill and dispatch instead: write the task prompt to a file, then
launch run-agy-watchdog.sh with it in the background (farm-out §Dispatch).

If a Claude subagent is genuinely right — the answer is a ruling, not a procedure — say why
in the prompt or description and re-issue. "Simpler to set up" is not a reason.
