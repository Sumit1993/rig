# `pkill -x agy` / `pkill -f "agy --model"` / `killall agy` reap every agy process on the

# quota death. farm-out says kill by PID, or by this run's --log-file slug.
# Rung: hook. Skipped: impossible (process namespaces are shared on the host), check (the command exists only at execution time).

Blocked: \`$pat\` matches every agy process on this machine, not just yours.

Other sessions' runs die as rc=137 with empty output, which reads as silent quota death and
costs them their retry budget chasing a cause that was you. This repo's own test suite did
exactly that today.

Kill by PID instead (\`kill -9 "\$AGY_PID"\`, captured as \$! at launch, or the pid
run-agy-watchdog.sh prints). If the PID is lost, match this run's --log-file slug:
\`kill -9 \$(pgrep -f "\$SLUG")\`. See farm-out references/handler.md, "Kill".

To see what you would have hit: \`pgrep -a agy\`, then \`readlink /proc/<pid>/cwd\` to tell
the runs apart by worktree.

To quote the command in prose, put it in a quoted heredoc to cat or tee, for example \`cat <<'EOF' > notes.md\`.
