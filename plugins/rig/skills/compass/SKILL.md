# Direction

GitHub is the record and this skill is the reader. There is no script. Run the commands below with `gh` from inside the repo. Never run an unfiltered `gh issue list`; picking by recency is the failure this replaces. The ruling with the evidence is the last superseding comment on `Sumit1993/rig#100`.

## The vocabulary

Nine labels, the same in every repo, and nothing else:

| kind | state | priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `decision` | `blocked`, `parked`, `needs-operator` | `p0`, `p1` |

Bot labels (`dependencies`, `github_actions`, `javascript`, `autorelease:*`) and the review-lane labels `coderabbit_review`, `claude_review` and `claude_review_skip` are mechanism, not vocabulary. Leave them alone and do not count them as drift.

A milestone is titled with the version it ships, `0.5.0`. A repo has at most two open: current and next. Line one of the description is the done-when sentence. There is no number prefix, no due date, and no order across repos.

Never create, rename or delete a label or a milestone. If the vocabulary lacks something, file an issue labelled `needs-operator` saying what and why. On a repo's first run the operator installs the labels and milestones, the skill never does.

## Step 0: review debt

Reviews land hours after a PR is marked ready, long after its session ended (`Sumit1993/rig#150`). Findings on the operator's open PRs come before any new pick. The SessionStart hook prints them as `Review debt in <repo>: ...`; without the hook:

```
repo=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
gh api graphql --paginate -f q="repo:$repo is:pr is:open author:@me -is:draft" \
  -f query='query($q: String!, $endCursor: String) { search(query: $q, type: ISSUE, first: 100, after: $endCursor) { pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor } nodes { ... on PullRequest { number title reviewThreads(first: 100) { totalCount nodes { isResolved } } } } } }' \
  --jq '.data.search.nodes[] | {number, title, total: .reviewThreads.totalCount, open: [.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved | not)] | length} | select(.open > 0 or .total > 100) | "#\(.number)\t\(.open) open of \(.total)\t\(.title)"'
```

One agent clears the whole list in one pass, PR by PR on each PR's branch:

- Fix what is right, one push per PR, then reply in each thread (`coderabbit-lane` §5, in-thread replies; `claude-review-lane` for `claude[bot]`). Never resolve a reviewer's thread; the next review round does.
- A finding that needs the operator's ruling is collected, not asked one at a time. Ask them all in one question at the end.
- The CodeRabbit routine re-reviews a PR whose threads all carry a reply. It never merges.
- A ready PR whose CodeRabbit review on the current head came back clean, with every thread resolved by the reviewer that opened it and checks green, is listed as ready to merge. Ask the operator once for the whole list and merge each one they grant (`pr-babysit` Phase 3, `MERGE_OK=<pr>`).

## Step 1: read the repo and report drift

```
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
gh label list --json name -q '.[].name'
gh api 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones?state=open' --jq '.[] | "\(.title)\t\(.open_issues) open, \(.closed_issues) closed\t\(.description | split("\n")[0])"'
```

Drift is any label outside the nine and the mechanism set, more than two open milestones, or a milestone title that is not a bare version. Report drift to the operator in one line each. Do not fix it.

## Step 2: the current milestone

Current is the lowest open version. Sort the titles with `sort -V` and take the first. If the repo has no open milestone, nothing is startable; say so and stop.

## Step 3: the pick is a batch

```
gh issue list --state open --milestone '<current>' --limit 500 --json number,title,labels,createdAt --jq '
  map(select(.labels | map(.name) | index("blocked") | not))
  | sort_by([(.labels | map(.name) | index("p0") == null), .createdAt])
  | .[] | "#\(.number)\t\(.labels | map(.name) | join(","))\t\(.title)"'
```

The first line is the lead. `p0` sorts to the front of its own milestone and nowhere else. `blocked` is skipped; the comment on that issue names the blocker. An issue whose body says it is blocked but carries no label is a triage note: open it, and if the blocker is real, add the `blocked` label with a comment.

The pick is the lead plus every other startable issue in the list that touches the same files: read the bodies and the Pointers, not the titles. One branch, one draft PR, `closes #a, closes #b`, marked ready once at the end. Each PR is one review slot and hours of queue wait, so two PRs where one would do cost twice. Work found mid-session on the same files joins the open draft; it gets its own PR only when it is its own unit.

An issue with no milestone is not startable. Count them and report the number:

```
gh issue list --state open --search 'no:milestone' --json number --jq length
```

## Step 4: what is in flight

```
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,isDraft,updatedAt --jq '.[] | select(.title | startswith("chore(deps)") | not) | "#\(.number)\t\(if .isDraft then "draft" else "ready" end)\t\(.title)"'
```

A ready PR on the lead means the batch is already taken. Before moving to the next line, compare that PR's files with the rest of the batch: a same-file issue it left out waits for that PR, or joins it, unless it is its own unit. An open draft on the same files is where the batch goes.

## Handoffs

Each repo's pinned issue is the handoff log. Its last comment says where the previous session stopped. Read it after the pick, never instead of it, and never treat a list in its body as a queue.
