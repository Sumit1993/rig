# Anti-stall: waiting on long work

Every stall had the same cause: the wait keyed on process liveness or a timer. Every wait keyed on durable evidence worked: a sentinel line, an artifact file, a commit.

## 1. Sentinel first

Every long command logs to a file and appends its own exit fact:

```bash
(<cmd> > "$LOG" 2>&1; echo "DONE rc=$?" >> "$LOG")
```

Without it the completion signal is transient and a missed wake loses it.

## 2. Wait on evidence, foreground or background by who waits

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 N); do grep -q DONE "$LOG" && exit 0; sleep 15; done; echo WATCH_TIMEOUT
```

- `N` is `expected_minutes * 4 + 40`. The loop length is the timeout. `WATCH_TIMEOUT` in the log means stop waiting and salvage.
- Main session: background, started right after launch. Its completion fires one notification and the session is there to receive it.
- Handler subagent: foreground, repeated bounded Bash calls. A handler never ends a turn while its run is alive. A backgrounded loop plus an ended turn destroys the context the wake would land in, the run goes unwatched, and the parent gets a completion notice for a handler that did nothing.
- The Monitor tool is banned for "did this finish". Gated on `pgrep` or timers it sleeps through wake after wake. Monitor is for open-ended watching only: new PR comments, a file that may change.

### Evidence only an MCP tool can read

When no shell can reach the evidence, the one poll left is a cron tick firing back into the session so the model calls the tool itself (`autopilot` §0, arm the wake-up).

- Do not call it a monitor. In the plan file it is "cron tick every N min, calls `<tool>`". Latency is the full interval and nothing fires between ticks.
- Set N from how fast the watched thing moves, and record the number beside the watch.
- Look for a shell path once first. A missing credential is the usual reason there is none, and a secret in CI can sometimes be granted to the box.
- A tick carries the same teardown duty as any watch (`autopilot` §3, the stall rule): kill the cron when the thing resolves.

Story: `gh-workflows-d1-cron-tick`.

## 3. Never wait on a condition the event prevents

Before arming a loop, ask whether the event you wait for could stop the exit condition from ever being true. If so the loop is silent forever and looks like slow progress. Do not arm it as written.

```bash
until [ "$(gh pr view 495 --json mergeStateStatus --jq .mergeStateStatus)" = "CLEAN" ]; do sleep 30; done
```

An unresolved review thread pins `mergeStateStatus` at `BLOCKED`, so the posted finding is the event that guarantees this never exits.

- A PR wait keys on `reviewThreads` and comment IDs, never on merge state. Any increase is the event.
- `BLOCKED` means "CI running" or "reviewer left findings", and the two want opposite responses. Query `reviewThreads`. Never guess.
- General form: the signal must be free to move when the event happens. If the event freezes it, pick another signal.

## 4. Check before waiting

Any wake, expected or not, including a user message: check the sentinel and expected artifacts first, then decide. A turn that ends "waiting" without a fresh check is the most common stall.

## 5. Watch evidence, not reports

A handler saying "waiting" is suspect. Never accept two consecutive "waiting" reports without reading the log or worktree yourself. Resume it with "check evidence now, continue foreground".

## 6. Deadline fallback

At expected duration plus 10 minutes of silence, read the logs yourself and salvage. Work often landed despite a silent handler. Check artifacts before re-running anything.

## 7. Batch mechanical sequences

A known list of steps becomes one unattended script with a per-step sentinel and a final marker, failures logged and continued:

```bash
for id in "${STEPS[@]}"; do
  <run "$id"> >> "$LOG" 2>&1; echo "STEPDONE $id rc=$?" >> "$LOG"
done
echo BATCH_COMPLETE >> "$LOG"
```

Wake once, at the end. Agent-per-step is where dozing lives.

## Killing safely

Any `pgrep -f` or `pkill -f` whose pattern appears in your own shell's command line kills your own shell, exit 144.

- Kill by PID. Capture `PID=$!` at launch and keep it. The rest is for a lost PID.
- The bracket trick (`"issue39[-]rca"`) is necessary and not sufficient. Every Bash tool call runs as `bash -c 'eval <your whole command>'`, so an `echo`, a `printf` or a filename in the same call holding the unbracketed string defeats it.
- Generate the marker at runtime: `SLUG="run-$(date +%s)"` cannot be in any ancestor's command line.
- Never build the pattern in the same Bash call that mentions the string. The kill gets its own call.
- `kill -9 "$PID"` preferred. `kill -9 $(pgrep -f "$SLUG")` as fallback, marker generated this run.
- A shared binary's processes are machine-global. `pkill -x <name>` reaches every session on the host, and the runs you did not mean to touch die as an empty non-zero exit that reads as an internal failure where they were watched.
- Prove a PID is yours, by a captured `$!` or a `readlink /proc/<pid>/cwd` you recognise, or kill nothing and say so.
- Match a pattern that is on the target's argv. A shell expands `$(cat file)` before exec, so a prompt file's name reaches only the launching shell, and killing on it reaps the wrapper. `farm-out` has the worked example.
- Self-test at arm time: `pgrep -a "<pattern>"` once, and read what came back. It must be the process you mean. "Exactly one PID matched" is not the test; a wrapper alone satisfies it.
